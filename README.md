# To-read
A reading list website
Demo can be visited at:

I'm doing this project mostly for the js experience, I'll try to fix some CSS bugs and make it responsive if I have some free time, but whatever I wanted to achieve in this project has already been done. Since I have a lot of projects on my hand right now, it might take a while until I add a more stylish design for the website. Also I intentionally try to avoid from using bootstrap because I want to train my CSS skills a lot more.

What I learned/gained from this project:
1, the existence of localStorage and how to use localStorage. 

2, Organize a JS structure. 

3, Render a website so that it can be interactive with the user.

4, More needed exposure with JS. 


This project's idea is taken from the Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library
I referenced and learned a lot from CatQueenCodes's interpretation of this project: https://github.com/CatQueenCodes/Project-Library
