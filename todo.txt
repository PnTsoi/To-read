1, Set up landing page.
2, Add UI: Including Card template for each book, Main title, and add style so that it looks nice. Challenge: don't use bootstrap unless you have to
3, Write js script to take in users form, add buttons.


Finished step 1 for now.

For step 2:
1, Add button styles

For step 3:
1, I think I can move on writing the script for now. The css problem can be solve on the side if I thought of a solution or why it is like that.
2, I'm thinking of adding a backend such that it can remember the user's book data as well. I've never done backend for nodejs before but this simple problem might be a good beginner's step.
3, so ummm.... I'm kinda stuck at js forms rn so I'll return to this project later lol.
