1, Set up landing page.
2, Add UI: Including Card template for each book, Main title, and add style so that it looks nice. Challenge: don't use bootstrap unless you have to
3, Write js script to take in users form, add buttons.


Finished step 1 for now.

For step 2:
1, Add button styles

For step 3:
1, I think I can move on writing the script for now. The css problem can be solve on the side if I thought of a solution or why it is like that.
2, I'm thinking of adding a backend such that it can remember the user's book data as well. I've never done backend for nodejs before but this simple problem might be a good beginner's step.
3, so ummm.... I'm kinda stuck at js forms rn so I'll return to this project later lol.

Okkk so I just figured something out. I don't actually need to run a back-end server to store the user's data of read books.
There's this thing called localStorage ( thanks to CatQueenCodes's own reading list project: https://github.com/CatQueenCodes/Project-Library, I was able to learn more about this),
you can store the data in the users' local storage. But... where does that data actually stored in the users' computer?

So apparently it's store in the users' disk, and get called upon everytime the browser is opened... I think?


9/18/2022: everything seems to work fine for now. I might wanna do some extra tests, but all things work as I expected it to be.
I'll start working on the css to make this site look more ... servicable!

9/19: I'll try to fix the finish-reading status bug, and add the feature to count books and unfinished books.
